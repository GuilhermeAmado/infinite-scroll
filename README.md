# Infinite Scroll

A simple web page that fetch the Unsplash API to display random images and makes network requests as the user scrolls before it reaches the bottom of the page giving the illusion that you are scrolling forever.

Note: the API limits the number of requests, so the infinite scrolling might stop working once the requests reaches the Unsplash API hourly limit.
